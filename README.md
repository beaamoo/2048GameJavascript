# 2048 Game

2048 is a single-player sliding block puzzle game designed by Gabriele Cirulli. This version of the 2048 game is a web-based implementation that features a dynamic color-changing progress bar and a toggle for different color schemes.

## Features

- **Classic 2048 Gameplay:** Combine tiles of the same number to try to reach the 2048 tile.
- **Color Progress Bar:** A visual indicator showing the highest value tile reached in the current game.
- **Color Scheme Toggle:** Switch between two different color schemes for the game tiles.
- **Responsive Design:** Playable on a variety of devices with a layout that adjusts to screen size.

## How to Play

Use the arrow keys (↑, ↓, ←, →) to slide the tiles across the grid. When two tiles of the same number touch, they merge into one with their combined value. The goal is to create a tile with the value of 2048.
